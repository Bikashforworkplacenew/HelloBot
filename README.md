# wp-hellobot
A sample help bot for Workplace which can act as an “online-admin” answering questions by simply querying from a google or office 365 spreadSheet.

What can the bot be used for ? 

* FAQ Bot : Bot that answers frequently asked questions for any product/feature/process
* Admin Bot : Common asked questions about organisation/company for employees 
* Acronym Bot : Can be used as a simple acronym bot used by noobs to help understand the meanings for multiple acronyms or terms used in the company
* Company quick links : There are multiple portals and docs in a company. Instead of maintaining bookmarks

* Workplace Admin updates the google sheet with all the necessary information. The sheet can be accessed and updated by anyone (irrespective of their work background)
* Workplace user queries the bot(@Help) for information about any specific topic
* @Help Bot  queries the sheets and replies back to the user
* In case a query made to the bot is absent in the sheets then the @help bot pings the admin with the unavailable query to update the sheet
